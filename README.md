HOLLYWOOD-HACKERMAN

aka hhm — The Ultimate Terminal Spectacle

⌨️💻⚠️💥 SYSTEMS ENGAGED 💥⚠️💻⌨️
Are you ready to hack the planet?
Do you dream of being a green-text God?
Want your terminal to look like it's running 30 shell scripts, compiling the Linux kernel, cracking AES-512, and launching nukes, all at the same time?

WELCOME TO HOLLYWOOD-HACKERMAN.
The tool you never needed, but always wanted.
💀👾💾👨‍💻🌐💣📡💻⚠️🖥️🦾💀

What Is This Black-Magic Sorcery?

Hollywood-Hackerman is a dramatic C program designed to make your terminal feel like a government agency is watching.
It simulates the wild, chaotic, movie-hacker aesthetic with maximum flair, zero functionality, and infinite style.
Think: green rain, fake commands, blinking cursors, vibes.

It was originally written by Google Gemini, then stolen and hacked together with raw terminal magic.
All of it... now AGPL-licensed. Free software, full drama.
(not that opensource™️ fake-freedom nonsense.)
